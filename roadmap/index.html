Find out more on how to contribute.](/contribute/).\n\n## Specification compliance\n\nA primary goal is to achieve full compliance for [SPARQL and other related specifications](/docs/query/advanced/specifications/).\nWhile the majority of SPARQL specifications are supported,\nsome edge-cases for [SPARQL 1.1 Query are not handled correctly yet](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/287),\nand [SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/435) is not implemented yet.\n\n## Future-oriented development\n\nIn addition to specification compliance, Comunica is being built with possible future specifications in mind.\nComunica should become a testbed for easily testing out new query features and techniques.\nFor instance, for efforts such as [RDF\\*/SPARQL\\*](https://blog.liu.se/olafhartig/2019/01/10/position-statement-rdf-star-and-sparql-star/)\nand [SPARQL 1.2](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/).\n\nWhile the architecture of Comunica has been built with this flexibility in mind,\nsome specific changes will need to be made before this is possible.\nFor instance, testing new SPARQL 1.2 query features will require the development of a new SPARQL query parser,\nsince our current parser ([SPARQL.js](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/SPARQL.js/)) is not flexible enough in that respect.\n\n## Different forms of query execution\n\nComunica's current query execution model relies on defining a set of _data sources_ to query over.\nWhile this traditional form of query execution works well in many cases,\nit can be too constrained in cases where _data is spread over many sources across the Web_, which are interlinked.\n\nOne alternative form of query execution is [Link-Traversal-based Query Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6328),\nwhere _links are followed_ on the Web to find data.\n\nA future goal of Comunica is the integration of such alternative forms of query exection.\n\n## Alternative query languages\n\nSPARQL is currently the (only) recommended way of querying knowdlege graphs that are represented in RDF.\nHowever, there is a wide range of new graph query languages emerging, such as GraphQL, Cypher and GQL, each having their own advantages.\nAs such, being able to express queries over knowledge graphs in different languages may be valuable for different use cases.\n\nFor instance, [GraphQL-LD](/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/) already offers one alternative language in which queries can be expressed.\nCompared to SPARQL, GraphQL-LD is less complex, but also less expressive. \n\n## Documentation\n\nIn order to lower the entry barrier to Comunica,\n[this website](https://github.com/comunica/website) is being built to act as a full reference guide.\n\nThe focus of the website is two-fold:\n\n* Document how to query with Comunica\n* Document how to modify Comunica\n\nBoth parts of the website should explain all possible capabilities of Comunica regarding querying and modification.\nFurthermore, several guides on how to perform common tasks should be present.\n\n## Developer experience\n\nNext to documentation, code-specific adjustments are needed\nto make it easier for developers to work with and in Comunica.\nFor example, errors can sometimes be too cryptic, which hinders development.\n\nA
