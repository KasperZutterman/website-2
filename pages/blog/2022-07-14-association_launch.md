As previously announced, we will be officially launching the Comunica Association during the fall of this year.
More concretely, we are organizing an online launch event on the 7th of September,
and we will be physically present at the Semantics conference in Vienna the week afterwards.

## üìñ How we got here

Last year, [we announced the Comunica Association](/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/),
to make Comunica sustainable in the long-term,
and to advance the [long-term roadmap](/roadmap/).
Up until now, we had soft-launch period during which a bounty program and membership structure was being setup.
The association has grown a lot since then,
with [multiple developers actively working on bounties](/association/bounties/),
and [multiple contributors supporting us via Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/comunica-association).

We thank the following founding members, which have supported the association for this launch:

- [IDLab - Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en)
- [Australian National University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au)
- [Dutch Digital Heritage Network (NDE)](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)

## üöÄ Online launch event

Wednesday 7 September 16:00 (Brussels time), we will livestream the launch of the Comunica Association.
During this event, several invited speakers from various companies will talk about their experiences with Comunica, and show off some demo's.
Speaker profiles during this event range from commercial users of Comunica,
to academics using Comunica for their research.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Semantics conference
