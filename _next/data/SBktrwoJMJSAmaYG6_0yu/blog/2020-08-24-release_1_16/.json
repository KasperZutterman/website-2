Let us know via [GitHub](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/435).\n\n## Property paths\n\nSPARQL 1.1 provides the [property paths syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#propertypaths),\nwhich is a power-user feature that allows complex paths between two resources to be expressed.\nAs of now, Comunica implements all property paths functionality according to the specification.\n\nFor example, property paths allow you to define alternative predicates:\n```sparql\nSELECT ?person WHERE {\n  [ rdfs:label \"Bruce Willis\"@en ] (dbpedia-owl:spouse|dbpedia-owl:child) ?person.\n}\n```\n\nTry out some example queries live via our Web client:\n\n* [Spouses and children of Bruce Willis](http://query.linkeddatafragments.org/#transientDatasources=http%3A%2F%2Ffragments.dbpedia.org%2F2016-04%2Fen&query=SELECT%20%3Fperson%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%5B%20rdfs%3Alabel%20%22Bruce%20Willis%22%40en%20%5D%0A%20%20%20%20(dbpedia-owl%3Aspouse%7Cdbpedia-owl%3Achild)%20%3Fperson.%0A%7D)\n* [In-laws of Brad Pitt](http://query.linkeddatafragments.org/#transientDatasources=http%3A%2F%2Ffragments.dbpedia.org%2F2016-04%2Fen&query=SELECT%20%3Fperson%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20dbpedia%3ABrad_Pitt%20dbpedia-owl%3Aspouse*%20%3Fperson.%0A%7D)\n* [Movies from directors who have directed movies with Brad Pitt](http://query.linkeddatafragments.org/#transientDatasources=http%3A%2F%2Ffragments.dbpedia.org%2F2016-04%2Fen&query=SELECT%20%3Fmovie%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%5B%20rdfs%3Alabel%20%22Brad%20Pitt%22%40en%20%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%5Edbpedia-owl%3Astarring%2Fdbpedia-owl%3Adirector%2F%5Edbpedia-owl%3Adirector%20%3Fmovie.%0A%7D)\n\nShould you run into any bugs related to property paths, \nbe sure to [report them on our issue tracker](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues).\n\n## CSV/TSV Serializers\n\nWhile there already was support for many [result formats](/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/) in Comunica,\n[CSV and TSV](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/) support was missing.\nAs of this release, this lack has been resolved.\nThey can be used by requesting the `text/csv` or `text/tab-separated-values` media types.\n\nFor example, try it out as follows from the command line:\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n    \"SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100\" \\\n    -t 'text/csv'\n```\n\n## Basic authentication\n\nSometimes, access to data on the Web requires [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication).\nAs of this release, you can [configure Comunica to pass the required credentials](/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/) to access these sources that require authentication.\n\nFor example, username and password can be passed from the command line:\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql https://username:password@example.org/page \\\n    \"SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }\"\n```\n\n## And more\n\nAside from the main features above, several fixes have been done.\nCheck out the [full changelog](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1160---2020-08-24) to read more about them.\n","excerpt":"\nWith the latest release of Comunica, we have achieved
