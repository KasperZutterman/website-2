title: 'Release 2.4.0: Better browser support and performance improvements'
---

We just released a new minor version of Comunica.
Here's an overview of the main changes.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

## Better browser support

When using Comunica in browser bundling tools such as Webpack,
polyfills had to be configured since Comunica made use of Node.js builtins.
As of this release, Comunica does not depend directly on these Node.js builtins anymore,
which means that Comunica can be bundled directly with tools such as Webpack without having to configure polyfills in a custom config.

This change was implemented by [@Tpt](https://github.com/Tpt) via a [bounty](https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/).

## Performance improvements

Thanks to some [internal changes inside AsyncIterator](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/b16e18888b0e93821c76e01a6efd9bcb3c4f9523), Comunica now runs slightly faster in general.

Furthermore, [some property path logic was rewritten](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/0ad833f8f32f7e3c2de1b22a0424da027656bf6a),
which makes * and + path queries significantly faster for large datasets.

## Tweaks to the HTTP service

The [HTTP service](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/) of Comunica (which exposes a SPARQL endpoint) has been polished.
On the one hand, several bugfixes have been applied to make the endpoint more stable when there are timeouts and long-running queries.
Furthermore, [some](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/4958206f6b042239efe2218ce268e4b981ce9e2c)
[features]((https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/4dd99fee904c64e9ef700eb5080197c4a03a36fa))
have been added to are useful when benchmarking with Comunica.
