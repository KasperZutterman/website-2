{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Exposing your custom config as an npm package","description":"Wrap your config in an npm package, and expose a CLI tool and a JavaScript API."},"body":"\nIn this guide, we will wrap our custom config into a new npm package,\nso that we can **expose it as a proper reusable query engine**.\nThis package will be able to do everything packages such as Comunica SPARQL (`@comunica/actor-init-sparql`) can do.\nThis means that this package will have a CLI tool, and that it will expose a JavaScript API for use in other packages.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nA fully functional example can be found\n<a href=\"https://github.com/comunica/examples/tree/master/packages/configure-sparql-http-solid\">here</a>.\n</div>\n\n## 1. Initialize a new package\n\nInitialize a new **empty npm package** as follows:\n```bash\n$ npm init\n```\n\nAll init packages have to extend from **Comunica SPARQL**.\nAs such, add it as a dependency as follows:\n```bash\n$ npm install @comunica/actor-init-sparql\n```\n\nWe recommend to also **install TypeScript** as a dev dependency:\n```bash\n$ npm install -D typescript\n```\n\nAdd a `tsconfig.json` file with the following contents:\n```text\n{\n  \"compileOnSave\": true,\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"lib\": [\n      \"es6\",\n      \"dom\"\n    ],\n    \"target\": \"es2017\",\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"preserveConstEnums\": true,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"inlineSources\": true,\n    \"declaration\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"index.ts\",\n    \"lib/**/*\",\n    \"bin/**/*\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"**/node_modules\",\n    \"**/test/*\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIf your custom config also depends on other packages\nthat are not included in Comunica SPARQL,\nyou have to install them here as well.\n</div>\n\n## 2. Add a config file\n\n### 2.1. Create config file\n\nWe assume here that **you already have created a custom config file**.\n[Click here to learn how to create one](/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/) should you not have done this already.\n\nCreate a `config/` folder, and add your config file (`config-default.json`) in here.\n\nIf you config file includes other config sets, you can include them in this folder as well.\nIn this case, you also have to make sure to include the context file in `components/context.jsonld`.\n\nThe only requirement here is that there is at least a file **`config/config-default.json`**.\n\n### 2.2. Declare config options in `package.json`\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIf your config file is decomposed into several files,\nyou may already have done this step.\n</div>\n\nBefore we can refer to other files within our config file,\nwe have to add some entries to our `package.json` file\nso that the config files can be found during engine initialization.\n\nConcretely, we need to **add the following entries to `package.json`**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package\",\n  \"lsd:contexts\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\": \"components/context.jsonld\"\n  },\n  \"lsd:importPaths\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/\": \"components/\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/config/\": \"config/\"\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nOn each line, make sure to replace `my-package` with your package `name`.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIf you want to learn more about what these config entries mean,\nread our guide on <a href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/\">Components.js</a>,\na dependency injection framework that Comunica uses.\n</div>\n\n## 3. Compiling the config into JavaScript\n\nIn order to make the query engine start as fast as possible,\nwe will pre-compile our config file into a JavaScript file.\n\nWe will configure this in such as way that we can still modify our config file if needed,\nand recompile the JavaScript file easily.\n\nFor this, add the following **scripts to our `package.json`** file:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    ...\n    \"prepublishOnly\": \"npm run build\",\n    \"build:engine\": \"comunica-compile-config config/config-default.json > engine-default.js\",\n    \"build:lib\": \"tsc\",\n    \"build\": \"npm run build:lib && npm run build:engine\",\n    \"postinstall\": \"npm run build\"\n  },\n}\n```\n\nTry if your script works correctly by running:\n```bash\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nAfterwards, you should have an `engine-default.js` file in your folder.\n\n## 4. Creating command line tools\n\nIn this step, we will create three command line tools:\n\n* `bin/query.js`: The main CLI tool.\n* `bin/http.js`: Script for starting a SPARQL endpoint.\n* `bin/query-dynamic.js`: A [CLI tool in which you can load a custom config](/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/).\n\nEach of these CLI tools are optional, and you only have to create those you want.\nFor this, **create the following files**:\n\n`bin/query.js`:\n```typescript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nimport {runArgsInProcessStatic} from \"@comunica/runner-cli\";\nrunArgsInProcessStatic(require('../engine-default.js'));\n```\n\n`bin/http.js`:\n```typescript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nimport {HttpServiceSparqlEndpoint} from \"@comunica/actor-init-sparql\";\nHttpServiceSparqlEndpoint.runArgsInProcess(process.argv.slice(2), process.stdout, process.stderr,\n  __dirname + '/../', process.env, __dirname + '/../config/config-default.json', () => process.exit(1));\n```\n\n`bin/http.js`:\n```typescript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nimport {runArgsInProcess} from \"@comunica/runner-cli\";\nrunArgsInProcess(__dirname + '/../', __dirname + '/../config/config-default.json');\n```\n\nAs a final step, we have to make sure that we expose our CLI tools from the package.\nAs such, add the following **bin entries to `package.json`**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"my-comunica\": \"./bin/query.js\",\n    \"my-comunica-http\": \"./bin/http.js\",\n    \"my-comunica-dynamic\": \"./bin/query-dynamic.js\"\n  },\n}\n```\n_You can replace `my-comunica` with any name you want.`\n\n## 5. Exposing a JavaScript API\n\nIn order to use your query engine as a dependency in other packages,\nwe have to expose its JavaScript API.\nWe will also immediately make it browser-friendly.\n\nFor this, first create a file **`index-browser.ts`**:\n```typescript\nimport {ActorInitSparql} from '@comunica/actor-init-sparql/lib/ActorInitSparql-browser';\n\n/**\n * Create a new comunica engine from the default config.\n * @return {ActorInitSparql} A comunica engine.\n */\nexport function newEngine(): ActorInitSparql {\n  return require('./engine-default.js');\n}\n```\n\nNext, create a file **`index.ts`**:\n```typescript\nexport {newEngine} from './index-browser';\n\nimport {ActorInitSparql} from '@comunica/actor-init-sparql/lib/ActorInitSparql-browser';\nimport {IQueryOptions, newEngineDynamicArged} from \"@comunica/actor-init-sparql/lib/QueryDynamic\";\n\n/**\n * Create a new dynamic comunica engine from a given config file.\n * @param {IQueryOptions} options Optional options on how to instantiate the query evaluator.\n * @return {Promise<QueryEngine>} A promise that resolves to a fully wired comunica engine.\n */\nexport function newEngineDynamic(options?: IQueryOptions): Promise<ActorInitSparql> {\n  return newEngineDynamicArged(options || {}, __dirname, __dirname + '/config/config-default.json');\n}\n```\n\nAs a final step,\nmake sure to expose the following entries in your **`package.json`** file:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"./index.js\": \"./index-browser.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Indicating what files should be published\n\nNot all files should be published to npm when releasing the package,\nand not all files should be added to git repositories.\n\nFor this **create the following files**:\n\n`.npmignore`\n```text\n```\n_`.npmignore` MUST exist and MUST be empty._\n\n`.gitignore`\n```text\nengine-default.js\nnode_modules\nlib/**/*.js\nlib/**/*.js.map\nlib/**/*.d.ts\ntest/**/*.js\ntest/**/*.js.map\ntest/**/*.d.ts\nbin/**/*.js\nbin/**/*.js.map\nbin/**/*.d.ts\nindex.js\nindex.js.map\nindex.d.ts\nindex-browser.js\nindex-browser.js.map\nindex-browser.d.ts\n```\n\nAs a final step, **add following entries to `package.json`**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"files\": [\n    \"components\",\n    \"config\",\n    \"bin/**/*.d.ts\",\n    \"bin/**/*.js\",\n    \"index.js\",\n    \"index.d.ts\",\n    \"index-browser.d.ts\",\n    \"index-browser.js\",\n    \"engine-default.js\"\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## 7. Publish to npm\n\nNow, you are ready to [publish your package to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages),\nand allow other to use it via the CLI or via the JavaScript API.\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_output_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
