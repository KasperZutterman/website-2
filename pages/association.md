The Association is currently in an **incubation phase**,
during which companies can place [**bounties on issues**](/association/bounties/),
and developers may work on them for an agreed upon price.

Additionally, you can also [**donate or become a member via Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/comunica-association)
to receive benefits such as placing your logo on our website.
After this incubation phase, certain membership tiers will also give your organization or company access to the board meetings of the Comunica Associationm
which will allow you to help shape the long-term vision and roadmap of Comunica and the Association.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:ruben.taelman@ugent.be) if you want to discuss alternative forms of support.
