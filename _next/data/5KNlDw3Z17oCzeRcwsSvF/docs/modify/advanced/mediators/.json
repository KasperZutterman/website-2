{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mediators","description":"An overview of all mediators in Comunica."},"body":"\nMediators form a critical part of [Comunica's core architecture](/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/).\nThey are responsible for **selecting one actor from a bus**, based on a given task.\n\nWhile actors perform the actual logic, they never communicate with each other directly.\nInstead, they always communicate through mediators, to reduce coupling between actors.\nIf a different actor selection technique is needed,\na different mediator can be configured without having to change any buses or actors.\n\n## Mediator implementations\n\n| Name | Package | Description |\n| ---- | ------- | ----------- |\n| Race | [`@comunica/mediator-race`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediator-race) | Picks the first actor that resolves its test. |\n| Number | [`@comunica/mediator-number`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediator-number) | Mediates over a single number field. It can either choose the actor with the maximum or with the minimum value. |\n| All | [`@comunica/mediator-all`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediator-all) | Special mediator that runs _all_ actors that resolve their test in parallel. |\n| Combine Pipeline | [`@comunica/mediator-combine-pipeline`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediator-combine-pipeline) | Special mediator that goes over all actors in sequence and forwards I/O. This requires the action input and the actor output to be of the same type. |\n| Combine Union | [`@comunica/mediator-combine-union`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediator-combine-union) | Special mediator that takes the union of all actor results. |\n\n## Mediator types\n\nComunica contains several packages named `@comunica/mediatortype-*`\nthat expose interfaces that extend the `IActorTest` interface.\nThese interfaces can be reused in different actors to indicate what properties can be mediated over.\n\nThe following mediator types are available:\n\n| Name | Package | Description |\n| ---- | ------- | ----------- |\n| HTTP Requests | [`@comunica/mediatortype-httprequests`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediatortype-httprequests) | Number of HTTP requests required for an action. |\n| Iterations | [`@comunica/mediatortype-iterations`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediatortype-iterations) | Number of iterations that are needed for joining streams. |\n| Priority | [`@comunica/mediatortype-priority`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediatortype-priority) | Priority of an actor, for example used for parsers and serializers in content negotiation. |\n| Time | [`@comunica/mediatortype-time`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/mediatortype-time) | Estimated time an action will take. |\n\n## Configuring and using a mediator\n\n### Defining a component mediator parameter\n\nThe following components file shows how a `mediatorJoin` parameter is added to [`@comunica/actor-query-operation-join`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-query-operation-join):\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-join/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/bus-query-operation/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-join\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"caqoj:Actor/QueryOperation/Join\",\n      \"@type\": \"Class\",\n      \"extends\": \"cbqo:Actor/QueryOperationTypedMediated\",\n      \"requireElement\": \"ActorQueryOperationJoin\",\n      \"comment\": \"A comunica Join Query Operation Actor.\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"@id\": \"caqoj:mediatorJoin\",\n          \"comment\": \"A mediator for joining Bindings streams\",\n          \"required\": true,\n          \"unique\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"constructorArguments\": [\n        {\n          \"extends\": \"cbqo:Actor/QueryOperationTypedMediated/constructorArgumentsObject\",\n          \"fields\": [\n            {\n              \"keyRaw\": \"mediatorJoin\",\n              \"value\": \"caqoj:mediatorJoin\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Instantiating a component mediator\n\nThe following config file shows how we instantiate an actor with a race mediator over the RDF join bus ([`@comunica/bus-rdf-join`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-rdf-join)):\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-join/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/mediator-race/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:my\",\n  \"actors\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"config-sets:sparql-queryoperators.json#myJoinQueryOperator\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationJoin\",\n      \"caqoj:mediatorJoin\": {\n        \"@id\": \"config-sets:sparql-queryoperators.json#mediatorRdfJoin\",\n        \"@type\": \"MediatorRace\",\n        \"cc:Mediator/bus\": { \"@id\": \"cbrj:Bus/RdfJoin\" }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\n### Invoking a mediator in TypeScript\n\nInvoking the mediator in a TypeScript actor implementation is done like this:\n```typescript\nimport { ActionContext, IActorTest, Mediator } from '@comunica/core';\nimport { ActorRdfJoin, IActionRdfJoin } from '@comunica/bus-rdf-join';\nimport { IMediatorTypeIterations } from '@comunica/mediatortype-iterations';\n\nexport class ActorQueryOperationJoin extends ActorQueryOperationTypedMediated<Algebra.Join> {\n\n  public readonly mediatorJoin: Mediator<ActorRdfJoin,\n  IActionRdfJoin, IMediatorTypeIterations, IActorQueryOperationOutput>;\n\n  public constructor(args: IActorQueryOperationJoinArgs) {\n    super(args, 'join');\n  }\n\n  public async testOperation(pattern: Algebra.Join, context: ActionContext): Promise<IActorTest> {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  public async runOperation(pattern: Algebra.Join, context: ActionContext): Promise<IActorQueryOperationOutput> {\n    const myAction: IActionRdfJoin = { ... }; \n    return this.mediatorJoin.mediate(myAction);\n  }\n}\n\nexport interface IActorQueryOperationJoinArgs extends IActorQueryOperationTypedMediatedArgs {\n  mediatorJoin: Mediator<ActorRdfJoin, IActionRdfJoin, IMediatorTypeIterations, IActorQueryOperationOutput>;\n}\n```\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/advanced/mediators","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_output_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/logos/","/research/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! ðŸŽ‰\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
