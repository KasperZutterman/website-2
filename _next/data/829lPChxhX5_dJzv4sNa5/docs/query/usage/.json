{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Usage showcase","description":"Examples of where Comunica is used."},"body":"\nComunica is being used in a variety of places for its querying and RDF-related capabilities.\nBelow, a couple of these uses are listed.\nFeel free to [contact us](/ask/) if you want your use of Comunica added to this list.\n\n## LDflex\n\n[LDflex](https://github.com/LDflex/LDflex) is a JavaScript library provides a convenient syntax for quickly writing and executing queries in a developer-friendly way.\nUsing the power of Comunica and JSON-LD contexts, you can write expressions like `person.friends.firstName` to get a list of your friends.\n\nLDflex is used within the [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) community to easily [interact with one or more Solid data pods](https://github.com/solid/query-ldflex/).\nUsing the compact syntax of LDflex, it is very simple to query from within [React components](https://github.com/solid/react-components).\n\n## GraphQL-LD\n\n[GraphQL-LD](https://github.com/rubensworks/graphql-ld.js) is a JavaScript library\nthat allows Linked Data to be queried via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) queries and a JSON-LD context.\nThe approach involves converting a GraphQL query and JSON-LD context to a SPARQL query,\nwhich can then be executed by any SPARQL query engine [such as Comunica](https://github.com/rubensworks/graphql-ld-comunica.js).\n\nIt can also be used execute [authenticated queries over Solid data pods](https://github.com/rubensworks/GraphQL-LD-Comunica-Solid.js),\nfor which [reusable React components](https://github.com/rubensworks/solid-react-graphql-ld.js) are available.\n\n## Node Quadstore\n\n[Node Quadstore](https://github.com/beautifulinteractions/node-quadstore) is a [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb-backed) graph database for Node.js and the browser.\n[Node Quadstore SPARQL](https://github.com/beautifulinteractions/node-quadstore-sparql) is a SPARQL engine on top of Node Quadstore that is powered by Comunica.\n\n## RDF Parse\n\n[RDF Parse](https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-parse.js) is a JavaScript library parses RDF based on content type or file name in a streaming manner.\nIt supports all of the major RDF serializations.\nInternally, this library makes use of the `rdf-parse` bus and actors from Comunica.\n\n## RDF Dereference\n\n[RDF Dereference](https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-dereference.js) is a JavaScript library dereferences URLs to get its RDF contents.\nThis tool is useful in situations where you have a URL, and you just need the parsed triples/quads, without having to concern yourself with determining the correct content type and picking the correct parser.\nInternally, this library makes use of the `rdf-dereference` bus and actors from Comunica.\n\n## RDF Play\n\n[RDF Play](https://rdf-play.rubensworks.net/) is a Web-based tool for performing simple RDF operations, such as parsing, serializing and dereferencing from URLs.\nInternally, this library makes use of RDF parsers from the Comunica framework, which enable streaming processing of RDF.\n\n## ESWC Conference 2020\n\nAll metadata of the [ESWC Conference (2020)](https://2020.eswc-conferences.org/) is [queryable](https://query.2020.eswc-conferences.org/)\nvia a jQuery widget instance of Comunica.\nIt features several example queries over a [Triple Pattern Fragments](https://linkeddatafragments.org/concept/) interface through which the ESWC 2020 metadata is published.\n","path":"/docs/query/usage","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/cite/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About"},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask"},"/cite/":{"title":"Cite"},"/contribute/":{"title":"Contribute"},"/docs/":{"title":"Documentation","index":true},"/docs/query/":{"title":"Query
