title: 'Release 1.20.0: SPARQL Update support'
---

With this new 1.20.0 release, we bring support for [SPARQL Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) queries to Comunica.
Next to this, several enhancements were made to improve developer experience,
minor new features, and important bug fixes.

## SPARQL Update

Up until now, Comunica only supported performing read-only queries over one or more sources.
With this update, it is possible to execute [SPARQL Update queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/)
to modify data inside a _source_, or direct changes to a separate _destination_.

The current implementation is fully compliant to the SPARQL Update specification,
and it passes all tests of the test suite.

Currently, Update support is limited to [RDF/JS stores](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/).
Support for updating other types of destinations is planned,
such as local RDF files, [Linked Data Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/),
[SPARQL endpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-protocol-20130321/),
[SPARQL Graph Store protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-http-rdf-update-20130321/), ...

No explicit support for transactions is available at the moment,
as we assume that RDF/JS stores handle this on their own.
Proper support for this at engine-level is planned.

## SPARQL endpoint worker threads

If you [use Comunica to expose a SPARQL endpoint](/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/),
you can now set the number of parallel worker threads using the `-w` flag:

```bash
$ comunica-sparql-http https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en -w 4
```

This will result in better performance when your endpoint serves many parallel requests.

Together with this change, the timeout handling has been improved,
as the old implementation would sometimes not terminate query executions even if the timeout was exceeded.

## Features, fixes and enhancements

Next to the changes above, several other features, fixes and enhancements were applied,
such the new [`@comunica/types`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/3f46a233883b699df87fcee3215516f97e15e346)
and [`@comunica/context-entries`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/12b9ee3e8e5bc2d0fadd662a3d6aeef838b87619) packages,
enabling [blank node correlation across results](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/d9b93b4608c69e6c8b710b664c37e47a1c0d41c7),
and a new [link queue bus](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/8de44d1da8e63c9b3a15c26dadcb003c2c00f136).
