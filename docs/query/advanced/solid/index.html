Comunica can be used to query over Solid data pods.
The default <a href="/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/">Comunica SPARQL engine</a>
can directly be used to query over public Solid data pods.</p><p>If you want to query over data pods that require authentication,
you will have to plug in <a href="https://github.com/comunica/actor-http-solid-auth-fetch">the Solid-specific HTTP actor</a>.
The easiest way to do this is by either making use of <a href="/docs/query/usage/#ldflex">LDflex</a>
or <a href="/docs/query/usage/#graphql-ld">GraphQL-LD</a> that ship with this Solid-specific actor by default.
Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/comunica/examples/tree/master/packages/configure-sparql-http-solid#readme">plug this Solid-specific actor into your own Comunica instance</a>.</p></main></div></div><footer>Â©2018 â€“ 2020Â <a href="http://www.ugent.be/">Ghent University</a>Â â€“Â <a href="http://www.imec.be/">imec</a>, Belgium<br/><a href="https://github.com/comunica/website">Source of this website</a></footer><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Solid","description":"Solid â€“ the Web-based decentralization ecosystem â€“ can be queried with Comunica."},"body":"\n## What is Solid\n\n[Solid](https://solidproject.org/) is a Web-based decentralization ecosystem\nwhere people are in control over their own data.\n\nSolid achieves this by giving everyone control over their own **personal data pod**.\nApplications are completely separate, and have to ask permission to access your data.\n\n## Querying Solid pods with Comunica\n\nSince Solid and Comunica have a compatible technology stack,\nComunica can be used to query over Solid data pods.\nThe default [Comunica SPARQL engine](/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/)\ncan directly be used to query over public Solid data pods.\n\nIf you want to query over data pods that require authentication,\nyou will have to plug in [the Solid-specific HTTP actor](https://github.com/comunica/actor-http-solid-auth-fetch).\nThe easiest way to do this is by either making use of [LDflex](/docs/query/usage/#ldflex)\nor [GraphQL-LD](/docs/query/usage/#graphql-ld) that ship with this Solid-specific actor by default.\nAlternatively, you can [plug this Solid-specific actor into your own Comunica instance](https://github.com/comunica/examples/tree/master/packages/configure-sparql-http-solid#readme).\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/advanced/solid","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/cite/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/configs/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcement or other of news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! ðŸŽ‰\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
