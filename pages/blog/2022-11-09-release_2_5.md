title: 'Release 2.5.0: Fixes, string sources, and HTTP error handling'
---

We just released a new small update. Here's an overview of the main changes.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

## String sources

If you have an RDF dataset available in a JavaScript string in some RDF serialization,
you can now immediately query over it by passing it as a `stringSource` as follows:
```javascript
const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`...`, {
  sources: [
    {
      type: 'stringSource',
      value: '<ex:s> <ex:p> <ex:o>. <ex:s> <ex:p2> <ex:o2>.',
      mediaType: 'text/turtle',
      baseIRI: 'http://example.org/',
    },
  ],
});
```

This feature has been contributed by [@constraintAutomaton](https://github.com/constraintAutomaton).

## HTTP error handling

With this update, query engines can become more robust against unstable or unavailable server.

Using the `httpRetryOnServerError`, `httpRetryCount`, and `httpRetryDelay` options,
you can make your engine retry requests for a number of times if the server produces an error for it.

Using the `recoverBrokenLinks` option, you can make your engine fall back to the [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) if a document has become unavailable.

Learn more about using these options on the [command line](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/)
and [query context](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/advanced/context/).

These features were contributed by [@Laurin-W](https://github.com/Laurin-W/) and [@jeswr](https://github.com/jeswr/).
