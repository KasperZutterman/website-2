title: 'Release 1.21.0: Hypermedia-based SPARQL Updating'
---

The 1.21.0 version is a smaller release,
that mainly introduces the necessary wiring to enable hypermedia-driven SPARQL update querying,
which lays the foundations for highly flexible updating of heterogeneous destinations, such as Solid data pods.

In other words, this provides the necessary ✨_magic_✨ for updating many different types of things.

## Hypermedia-based updates

A key feature of Comunica is its ability to [automatically detect the type of source via hypermedia](/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/),
and alter its query process based on the source's capabilities.
With this new update, this hypermedia-based logic has also been added to the handling of update queries.

Concretely, if you pass a destination by URL to Comunica,
the capabilities of this destination will be detected,
and an appropriate destination handler will be used.

With this update, we provide support for [a single hypermedia destination type](/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/):
the [SPARQL Update-based PATCH API](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-rdf-update-hypermedia-patch-sparql-update).
Such a destination is an HTTP APIs accepting PATCH requests containing SPARQL Update queries (`application/sparql-update`),
such as [Solid servers](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-rest.md#alternative-using-sparql-1).

In future updates, we intend to support more types of hypermedia-based destinations as well,
such as [SPARQL endpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-protocol-20130321/),
and [Linked Data Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/).

Learn more about updating from the [command line](/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/)
or from a [JavaScript application](/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/) in the documentation. 

## Features, fixes and enhancements

Next to the changes above, several minor features, fixes and enhancements were applied,
such as [more expressive configuration of JSON-LD parsing](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/199710d70b01d22ea40fe5e12e16a9d8800f32fc),
proper [CLI exit codes](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/00aa446cc8d2fd713711787b8a59f45c266947ea),
and [changing the context in the `optimize-query-operation` bus](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/81373206a17d0fcb8d3af701e5266287113d545c).
Check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1210---2021-04-27) to read more about them.
