The week after [the online launch event of the Comunica Association](/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/),
we will be present at the European [Semantics Conference](https://2022-eu.semantics.cc/) in Vienna from September 13 until September 15.

Be sure to attend the conference if you want to talk to us there.
We will have a **booth** at which you can find us during the breaks,
and we will have a **talk about Comunica** at the main conference.
