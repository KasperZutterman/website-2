This is where they accept generic input parameters, such as CLI arguments.\n    * **Comunica SPARQL:** Extracts things like query and output format from input arguments.\n        * **Context Preprocess:** A bus in which actors can optionally modify the [query context](/docs/query/advanced/context/).\n        * **SPARQL Parse:** Parsing the SPARQL query into SPARQL algebra.\n        * **Optimize Query Operation:** Applies optional optimizations to the SPARQL algebra before actual execution.\n        * **Query Operation:** Executes the query operation.\n            * **Join:** Handles joins between multiple query operations via its own separate bus.\n            * **Quad Pattern:** Evaluates triple/quad pattern operations via the *RDF Resolve Quad Pattern* bus, which translates a quad pattern into a stream of quad.\n                * **Federated:** Translates the array of sources in the [query context](/docs/query/advanced/context/) into the union of quad streams by resolving each source separately in the *RDF Resolve Quad Pattern* bus.\n                * **Hypermedia:** Resolves the quad stream of a resource by interpreting hypermedia links and controls.\n                    * **RDF Dereference:** Dereferences a path or URL into a stream of quads, which internally makes use of several parsers in the *RDF Parse* bus.\n                    * **RDF Metadata:** Extracts the quads relevant for metadata from the stream of data quads.\n                    * **RDF Metadata Extract:** Create an object with metadata for a given metadata quad stream.\n                    * **RDF Resolve Hypermedia Links:** Determines which links should be followed from the metadata of the current source.\n                    * **RDF Resolve Hypermedia:** Handle a source based on the extracted metadata.\n                        * **None:** The source is considered a raw RDF file, for which all data quads matching the quad pattern are returned.\n                        * **SPARQL:** The source is considered a SPARQL endpoint if it has a service description, for which we use the SPARQL protocol.\n                        * **QPF:** The source is considered a [Triple/Quad Pattern Fragments](https://linkeddatafragments.org/) interface.\n        * **SPARQL Serialize:** Serializes the query result into a text-based serialization.\n\n[Click here for a full
