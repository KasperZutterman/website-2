Other graphs can be represented with named or blank nodes.\n\n[RDF quads](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#quad-interface) are defined as an object with RDF terms for **subject**, **predicate**, **object** and **graph**.\nAn RDF triple is an alias of a quad,\nwhere the graph is set to the default graph.\nFor the remainder of this document, I will just refer to RDF quads.\n\nFinally, a [Data Factory](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#datafactory-interface) interface is defined,\nwhich allows you to easily create terms and quads that conform to this interface.\nDifferent Data Factory implementations exist, such as [`@rdfjs/data-model`](https://github.com/rdfjs-base/data-model)\nand the factory from [`N3.js`](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js#interface-specifications).\nFor example, creating a quad for representing someone's name with a data factory can be done like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst factory = require('@rdfjs/data-model');\n\nconst quad = factory.quad(\n  factory.namedNode('https://www.rubensworks.net/#me'), // subject\n  factory.namedNode('http://schema.org/name'),          // predicate\n  factory.literal('Ruben')                              // object\n);\n```\n\nReading raw values from the quad can be done as follows:\n\n```javascript\nquad.subject.value === 'https://www.rubensworks.net/#me';\nquad.predicate.value === 'http://schema.org/name';\nquad.object.value === 'Ruben';\n```\n\nFor checking whether or not quads and terms are equal to each other, the `equals` method can be used:\n\n```javascript\nfactory.literal('Ruben').equals(factory.literal('Ruben'));  // true\nfactory.literal('Ruben').equals(factory.literal('Ruben2')); // false\nquad.equals(quad); // true\n```\n\n## Stream interfaces\n\nComunica handles most parts of query execution in a **streaming** manner,\nwhich means that some query results may already be returned\neven though other results are still being processed.\n\nNext to the RDFJS data model, a dedicated specification exist for handling [RDF streams](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/),\nwhich is of high important to Comunica.\n\nOne interface of high importance is the [RDF/JS `Source` interface](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#source-interface).\nYou can [pass a custom `Source` to Comunica to execute queries over it](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/).\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/cite/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/configs/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcement or other of news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! ðŸŽ‰\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
