{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Querying over RDF/JS sources","description":"If the built-in source types are not sufficient, you can pass a custom JavaScript object implementing a specific interface."},"body":"\nOne of the [different types of sources](/docs/query/advanced/source_types/) that is supported by Comunica\nis the [RDF/JS `Source` interface](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#source-interface).\nThis allows you to pass objects as source to Comunica as long as they implement this interface.\n\nAn RDF/JS `Source` exposes the [`match`](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#source-interface) method\nthat allows quad pattern queries to be executed,\nand matching quads to be returned as a stream.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nLearn more about RDF/JS in this <a href=\"/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/\">RDF/JS guide</a>.\n</div>\n\nSeveral implementations of this `Source` interface exist.\nIn the example below, we make use of the [`Store` from `N3.js`](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js#storing)\nthat offers one possible implementation when you want to [query over it with Comunica within a JavaScript application](/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/):\n```javascript\nconst store = new N3.Store();\nstore.addQuad(\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/Pluto'),\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/type'),\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/Dog')\n);\nstore.addQuad(\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/Mickey'),\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/type'),\n  namedNode('http://ex.org/Mouse')\n);\n\nconst result = await myEngine.query(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: [store],\n});\n```\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nInstead of the default Comunica SPARQL package (<code>@comunica/actor-init-sparql</code>),\nthe <a href=\"https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-init-sparql-rdfjs#readme\">Comunica SPARQL RDF/JS (<code>@comunica/actor-init-sparql-rdfjs</code>)</a>\ncan also be used as a more lightweight alternative\nthat <i>only</i> allows querying over RDF/JS sources.\n</div>\n\n## Optional: query optimization\n\nThe RDFJS [Source interface](http://rdf.js.org/#source-interface) by default only exposed the `match` method.\nIn order to allow Comunica to produce more efficient query plans,\nyou can optionally expose a `countQuads` method that has the same signature as `match`,\nbut returns a `number` or `Promise<number>` that represents (an estimate of)\nthe number of quads that would match the given quad pattern.\nCertain `Source` implementations may be able to provide an efficient implementation of this method,\nwhich would lead to better query performance.\n\nIf Comunica does not detect a `countQuads` method, it will fallback to a sub-optimal counting mechanism\nwhere `match` will be called again to manually count the number of matches.\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/cite/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcement or other of news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! ðŸŽ‰\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
