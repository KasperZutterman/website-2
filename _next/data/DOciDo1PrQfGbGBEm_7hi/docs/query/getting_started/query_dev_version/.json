{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Query using the latest development version","description":"If you want to make use of the latest changes that are not released yet"},"body":"\nWhile the [Comunica GitHub repository](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) receives regular commits,\nwith fixes for bugs or new features,\nthese changes are not always immediately published as a new release on the npm package manager.\n\nWhile we always recommend using a released version of Comunica,\nthere are situations where you may want to make use of the **latest development version** from GitHub instead.\nFor example, if your application depends on a new _feature_ or _fix_ in Comunica,\nand you already want to develop or test your application before the new Comunica release is available.\n\nIn this guide, we will do this by setting up the **Comunica development environment**.\n\n## 1. Setup the Comunica development environment\n\nIf you want to make use of the latest development version,\nyou will have to **clone** the GitHub repository,\nand **install** it via the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/):\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/comunica/comunica.git\n$ cd comunica\n$ yarn install\n```\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nSetting up the development via the npm package manager will not work due to the Comunica repository making use\nof the <a href=\"https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/\">Yarn workspaces functionality</a>.\n</div>\n\n## 2. Querying from the command line\n\nIf installation is successful, you can navigate to any package and make use of it\nsimilar to how you would when it has been installed via npm.\n\nFor example, executing a SPARQL query from the command line with Comunica SPARQL\ncan be done by navigating to `packages/actor-init-sparql`, and invoking `bin/query.js`:\n```bash\n# cd packages/actor-init-sparql\n$ node bin/query.js https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n    \"SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100\"\n``` \n\nYou can execute any of the commands explained in the [CLI guide](/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/)\nby simply replacing `comunica-sparql` with `node bin/query.js`.\n\nIf you want to [set up a SPARQL endpoint](/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/),\nyou can use `node/http.js` instead of `comunica-sparql-http`.\n\n## 3. Linking Comunica SPARQL to your package\n\nIf you have a [JavaScript application that makes use of Comunica SPARQL](/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/),\nthen you can **link** it to your local Comunica development environment.\n\nThis can be done by first indicating that Comunica SPARQL can be linked (starting from the Comunica development environment folder):\n```bash\n$ cd packages/actor-init-sparql\n$ yarn link\n```\n\nNext, in the folder of your JavaScript package,\nwe can link Comunica SPARQL as follows:\n```bash\n$ yarn link \"@comunica/actor-init-sparql\"\n```\n\nNow, your application will use the development version of Comunica instead.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIf you want to go back to the npm version of Comunica SPARQL,\nthen you first have to unlink it from your application by running <code>yarn unlink \"@comunica/actor-init-sparql\"</code>.\n</div>\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_output_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/logos/","/research/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! ðŸŽ‰\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
