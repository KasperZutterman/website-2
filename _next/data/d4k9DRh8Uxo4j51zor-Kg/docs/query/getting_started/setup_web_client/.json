{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up a Web client","description":"Set up a user-friendly static Web page where SPARQL queries can be executed client-side"},"body":"\nIf you want to easily **demonstrate** a couple of SPARQL queries on a **Web page**,\nor if you want to show off your custom built Comunica engine,\nthen you can do this using the [Comunica jQuery widget](https://github.com/comunica/jQuery-Widget.js/).\n\nAs an example, a public instance of this widget is available at http://query.linkeddatafragments.org/.\n\n## 1. Installation\n\nSince Comunica runs on Node.js, make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.\n\nNext, we can [clone the Comunica jQuery widget repo](https://github.com/comunica/jQuery-Widget.js/), and install it:\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/comunica/jQuery-Widget.js.git\n$ cd jQuery-Widget.js\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## 2. Starting the built-in Web server\n\nThe widget comes with its own (optional) Web server,\nwhich can be started as follows:\n```bash\n$ npm run dev\n```\n\nNow, you page will be live at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nThis port can be changed to something else by adding the <code>--port</code> option\nwithin the <code>dev</code> script in <code>package.json</code>.\n</div>\n\n## 3. Building a static Website for production\n\nThe built-in Web server should primarily be used for testing.\nIf you want to deploy this page on a Web server,\nsomething like [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is recommended.\n\nYou can build a production-ready version of this page as follows:\n```bash\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nThe contents of the `build` folder can now be deployed on to any Web server.\n\n## 4. Changing the default queries and datasets\n\nYou'll notice that the page contains some example queries and datasets by default.\nYou can change these by modifying the contents of the `queries/` folder and the `settings.json` file.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nWhen running the built-in dev server, the process will have to be restarted after every change to the queries or settings.\n</div>\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/blog/","/cite/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcement or other of news.","blog_index":true},"/cite/":{"title":"Cite","description":"Reference Comunica in a scientific publication."},"/contribute/":{"title":"Contribute","description":"Contribute to the development of Comunica."},"/docs/":{"title":"Documentation","description":"Overview of all Comunica documentation.","index":true},"/docs/query/":{"title":"Query with Comunica","description":"Learn how to execute queries in different environments.
