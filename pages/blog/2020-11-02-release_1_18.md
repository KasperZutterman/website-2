title: 'Release 1.18.0: Smaller Web bundles and Microdata parsing'
---

This post gives a brief overview of the new 1.18.0 release.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

## Smaller Web bundle sizes

Thanks to [Jacopo Scazzosi](https://github.com/jacoscaz),
the **Webpack bundle size** of the default Comunica config has been reduced from **1.47 MiB to 1.15 MiB**.
This reduction is mainly caused by swapping to smaller and more Web-friendly dependencies.

These changes were applied in preparation of the new release of [Quadstore](https://github.com/beautifulinteractions/node-quadstore),
a Comunica-powered RDF graph database where small bundle sizes are crucial.

## Microdata parsing

Comunica already supported parsing RDFa from HTML (and other XML-like) documents.
Since Microdata is [the most popular form of structured information on the Web](http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2019-12/stats/stats.html),
it makes a lot of sense to be able to query over this as RDF.
As such, we plugged in the recently created [Microdata to RDF Streaming Parser](https://github.com/rubensworks/microdata-rdf-streaming-parser.js) into the default Comunica SPARQL config.

Should you not need this parser in your querying use case,
no worries, you can easily exclude this by creating a [custom config](https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/).

## Fixes and enhancements

Next to the changes above, several other smaller fixes and enhancements (such as [Emoji-support in query expressions](https://github.com/comunica/sparqlee/commit/4b873834a38c35329495d142eaf1c59f56fc0038)) were applied.
Check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1180---2020-11-02) to read more about them.
