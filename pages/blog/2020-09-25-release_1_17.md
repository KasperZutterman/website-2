## Hacktoberfest

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a yearly event during the month of October to celebrate open-source projects,
where everyone is invited to contribute to projects by submitting pull requests.
Once a certain number of pull requests has been made, you will receive some goodies.

If you're interested to participate in this event,
we have marked several issues with the label [`hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest),
which are well suited for first-time contributors.

Happy hacking! ðŸª“

## Release 1.17.0

As of today, version 1.17.0 has been released.
It mainly contains [a fix for the bug where some queries would never terminate without producing further results](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/3095b269f1d98d706d1056495123a69bffe3b457).
Next to this, it features some convenience features such as
[making the logger data argument lazy](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/e6d7cee1f7622e4bcb73188a0060d5d9823958f0),
[ensuring the internal SPARQL endpoint defaults to application/json when no content type is requested](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/cdde3559b51825eaebb686fffe0a9edf7c8ef238),
and a fix for [http-based JSON-LD contexts not being retrievable within browsers](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/2d0818c64e5bfbbb334ecbccb7b5a98a69263d1c).
It also lays the groundwork for [RDF* support](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/594) in the near future.

Check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1170---2020-09-25) to read more about them.
