for easily testing out new query features and techniques.\nFor instance, for efforts such as [RDF\\*/SPARQL\\*](https://blog.liu.se/olafhartig/2019/01/10/position-statement-rdf-star-and-sparql-star/)\nand [SPARQL 1.2](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/).\n\nWhile the architecture of Comunica

cases.\n\nFor instance, [GraphQL-LD](/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/) already offers one alternative language in which queries can be expressed.\nCompared to SPARQL, GraphQL-LD is less complex, but

Comunica regarding querying and modification.\nFurthermore, several guides on how to perform common tasks should be present.\n\n## Developer experience\n\nNext to documentation, code-specific
