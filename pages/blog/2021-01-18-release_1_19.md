title: 'Release 1.19.0: Simplifications for extensions'
---

The 1.19.0 release focuses on simplications for developing Comunica extension.
It contains no significant fixes or changes for end-users.

## Components.js 4

Comunica's modules are wired together using the [Components.js](/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/) dependency injection framework.
As of recently, Components.js [has been updated](https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js)
to major release version 4, which features several simplifications for developers.

While this release is backwards-compatible,
we do recommend developers of Comunica modifications to make the following tweaks.

### Reduce clutter in `package.json`

All Comunica modules would typically contain the following entries in their `package.json` files:

```json
{
  ...
  "lsd:module": "https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-abstract-bindings-hash",
  "lsd:components": "components/components.jsonld",
  "lsd:contexts": {
    "https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-abstract-bindings-hash/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld": "components/context.jsonld"
  },
  "lsd:importPaths": {
    "https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-abstract-bindings-hash/^1.0.0/components/": "components/"
  },
  ...
}
```

This can now be simpified to:

```json
{
  ...
  "lsd:module": true
  ...
}
```

### Update Components.js context version

If you define your own JSON-LD contexts,
it is recommended to update to the latest version of the Components.js version

```text
-   "https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld",
+   "https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^4.0.0/components/context.jsonld",
```

While this change is optional, you will see a startup warning mentioning the use of a deprecated context URL.

## Next steps

In the future, we plan further simplifications to Comunica modifications.
Concretely, we intend to enable to automatic generation of module and component files based on TypeScript source code.
