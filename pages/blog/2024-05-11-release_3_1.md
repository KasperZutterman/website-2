title: 'Release 3.1: ðŸŒ± New package with tiny bundle size'
---

The primary addition in this release is the new [`@comunica/query-sparql-rdfjs-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/query-sparql-rdfjs-lite) package,
which is optimized for small browser bundle size.
Currently, the minified size of this package is 648,88 KB (145,79 KB when gzipped).
This is about as small as you can get without removing required functionality from the SPARQL 1.1 spec
But if you don't need everything from SPARQL 1.1, it could get much smaller even!

Besides this, several fixes were applied, and some internal changes to our CI to better
[track the browser bundle size](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/f212b9262f5d2a12a40848f01132299904dc132c)
and [overall query performance](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/1d8b0d202a7d4728e3692764b33d8795686ce5a0) over time.
