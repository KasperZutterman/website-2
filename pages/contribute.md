## Report bugs or request features

The easiest way to contribute to Comunica is by **reporting the bugs** your encounter,
and **requesting new features** or enchancements.

Both of these should be done via [**GitHub issues**](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues).
Make sure to be as descriptive as possible, and completely fill in the requested template.

## Fix bugs or implement new features

If there is a certain bug that annoys you,
or if you see the opportunity for a new feature that would make your life easier,
you are welcome to contribute by submitting a **pull request**.
Before you open a pull request, it is considered a good practise to first
[open an issue](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues) or [discuss it with the community](/ask/).

When contributing, make sure to keep in mind the following:
* Read how to [set up a development environment](https://github.com/comunica/comunica#development-setup).
* [Use descriptive, imperative commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Pull requests should pass all checks
    * Unit tests with 100% branching coverage (`yarn test`)
    * Clean code with passing linter (`yarn run lint`)
    * Code documentation
    * Signing the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/comunica/comunica)
* Only add the files that are needed, so don't blindly do a `git -a`. (avoid adding editor-specific files)
* A good editor can make your life a lot easier. For example, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) can be used for free with an academic license.
